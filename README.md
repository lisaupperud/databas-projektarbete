This project involves developing a Java application that integrates with a database to manage job roles. The application will allow users to perform basic operations on job roles, such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting job roles. Additionally, the project requires creating a table in the database to store information about job roles, including fields like role_id, title, description, salary, and creation_date.

The Java application will communicate with the database through Java classes that handle the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The project also includes testing functionality to verify the operations, with proper handling of exceptions and database resources to ensure clean resource management.

Further, the application will feature an employee system, where each employee is linked to a job role. Users can log in to view their job role information, and the application will support SQL JOIN operations to retrieve both employee and job role data from the database.

This project provides practical experience in working with relational databases, SQL queries, and Java's database interaction capabilities, helping you understand how to build and manage database-driven applications
